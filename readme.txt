Using Genlauncher, add the ZIP folder as the mod file, give it a name like "FireRainV's Mod" version "1.0".
Otherwise, you can just drag and drop all the files into a clean install of ZH.

You can run the batch script so maps like the "Army Unlocker" (whichs allows everyone to access the Ultimate Boss General and Classic Boss General) will be added to your maps folder.
CPU players cannot play as those armies due to a ZH hardcoded AI limits.
