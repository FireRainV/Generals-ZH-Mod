Major:

The command center of the new armies is the same as their normal counterpart. However, it will say "Boss Command Center" when hovered by.

An enemy GLA Boss Toxin Network looks weird when revealed by stealth detectors.

Terrorists cannot make a car bomb. The reason being is because the civilian army is removed to allow the new bosses to be controllable by a CPU.



Minor:

Some general voice lines in challenge mode won't be triggered if the new armies are used because only the win condition was added.
